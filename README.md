# Angular Nx Monorepo

This is an Nx-based monorepo that contains multiple Angular applications and shared libraries. The current applications in this workspace are:

- **Inventory** (`apps/inventory`)
- **Cron Evaluator** (`apps/cron-evaluator`)
- **Angular Store** (`apps/angular-store`)

---

## üì¶ Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16+ recommended)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) or `npm`
- [Nx CLI](https://nx.dev/cli) globally (optional but recommended)

npm install -g nx


üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup
Clone the repository and install dependencies:

git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo-folder>
npm install


## Common Error Issues: 

1.npx: command not found 

npx not available in system

2.bash: nx: command not found 

Running nx directly without global install 

Use npx nx ... instead 

3.NX Unable to resolve @nrwl/angular:lib 

Preset not installed in workspace 

Run: npm install -D @nrwl/angular
